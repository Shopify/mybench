`microbench`
============

`microbench` is a suite of queries designed to test the performance of different parts of MySQL. It is based on common query patterns that we observe in production, but also from a first-principled approach.
Note that the `eventrate` command-line argument is ignored for `microbench` -- see the individual arguments listed in `main()`.
